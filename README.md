# Hackathon-2

Short project README for the files in this workspace.

## Project

This repository contains files and notebooks created for the Hackathon-2 project. It includes example notebooks, a small Python script, and supporting data files used during the hackathon.

## Contents

- `app.py` - Python script (entry point for experiments or app).  
- `Hackathon_2_end_term.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with project work.  
- `Hackathone_2_Data.ipynb` - Additional notebook with data work.  
- `Hackathon_Data_dashborad.twb` - Tableau workbook (dashboard file).  
- `PEP_Student_Performance_Final.xlsx` - Example dataset spreadsheet.  
- `jsonschema.exe`, `streamlit.exe`, `watchmedo.exe` - executables found in the workspace.  

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (if you plan to run `app.py` or the notebooks).  
- Git (already used to store this project).  

Recommended quick setup (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\HP\Downloads\Hackathone_end_term"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you add a requirements file
```

Running the main script (if applicable):

```powershell
python app.py
```

Open the notebooks using Jupyter or VS Code's notebook support:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

## Notes

- This README is intentionally minimal. If you want, I can detect Python dependencies from `app.py` and generate a `requirements.txt` file.
- If some executables were added to the repo by mistake (for example `streamlit.exe`), consider removing them and adding an appropriate `.gitignore` entry to avoid committing large binaries.

## Contributing

If you want to add more documentation, tests, or a proper project structure (package, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`), I can help scaffold those changes and push them.
